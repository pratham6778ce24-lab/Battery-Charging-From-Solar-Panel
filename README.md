# Battery-Charging-From-Solar-Panel
Simulation Of Solar Battery Charging Using Cisco Packet Tracer ( Applied Industrial IoT Project)

# Aim:
To design and simulate a renewable IoT-based energy system in Cisco Packet Tracer where a solar panel generates DC power, the power meter monitors energy flow, and the battery stores the energy. The system also includes a network setup using a switch, PC, and server to demonstrate basic IoT connectivity.
# Problem Statement:
Traditional energy systems depend on non-renewable power sources, which are unsustainable in the long run. Solar energy provides a clean alternative, but real-time monitoring and data communication require IoT-based integration. This project aims to create a simulation where:
1. A solar panel charges a battery,
2. A power meter monitors energy production,
3. A basic IoT network (PC, Server, Switch) enables communication and further monitoring possibilities.
This allows users to understand the concept of renewable energy storage and IoT-enabled monitoring using Cisco Packet Tracer.
# Scope of the Solution:
1. To simulate a renewable energy–based system using Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. To demonstrate how solar energy is stored in a battery.
3. To show energy monitoring through a power meter.
4. To integrate basic IoT networking using a PC, server, and switch.
5. To provide a foundation for future smart energy and IoT-based grid systems.
# Required Components to Develop the Solution:
Software / IDE:
1. Cisco Packet Tracer (IoT Version) – Used to design and simulate the solar charging system.
# Hardware (Simulated Components):
1. Solar Panel (IoT1):
Generates DC electrical energy from simulated sunlight.
2. Battery (IoT3):
Stores the energy supplied by the solar panel.
3. Power Meter (IoT2):
Measures the power generated and the energy flowing into the battery.
4. 2960-24TT Network Switch:
Connects PC, server, and IoT devices for network communication.
5. PC (PC0):
Used for monitoring or accessing network services.
6. Server (Server0):
Acts as a data storage or monitoring point (if extended to IoT dashboard).
7. Connecting Wires:
Used for electrical (DC) and network connections.
# Working Description: 
1. The solar panel generates DC power based on simulated sunlight conditions.
2. The generated power flows through the power meter, which monitors real-time energy output.
3. The battery receives the DC energy and begins charging.
4. The network switch connects the PC, server, and IoT devices, enabling communication.
5. The PC or server can be used for monitoring or controlling the system if expanded to an IoT dashboard.
   # Conclusion:
   The simulation demonstrates a basic renewable energy charging system integrated with an IoT-based network structure.
